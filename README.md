# HomeLab - Purpose & Goals

## PURPOSE
The purpose of my homelab, a collection of hardware and software, is to provide online and digital services that make my digital life rich, robust, and convenient while also protecting the privacy and confidentiality of my personal data through self-hosting.

## GOALS
- Run services that improve my daily life â€” such as media servers, home automation, and personal websites.
- Make everything as private and secure as possible, by keeping my data under my control.
- Reduce my dependence on cloud services (Google, Dropbox, etc.) for sensitive files and data.
- Build systems that are fun to use, reliable during power or internet outages, and easy to upgrade over time.
- Learn and experiment with new technology at my own pace.
  
# Homelab Meta Project Plan - Purpose & Goals

## PURPOSE
This meta project plan is an overview for the many projects that will collectively result in my homelab. In particular, this plan will focus on infrastructure, standards, procedures, and methods for making sure these services are stable and highly reliable, well documented, and able to be quickly recovered if something goes wrong.

## GOALS
- Organize all my current and future homelab projects in one easy-to-find place.
- Define clear standards, procedures, and repeatable steps for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining every part of the homelab.
- Write clear documentation as I go, so I can always remember what was done and how it works.
- Mandate careful documentation for every service, configuration, and custom script using README files and a centralized wiki.
- Set up simple, reliable backup routines for all important files and configurations, with step-by-step instructions for recovery.
- Start every project with strong security basics, specifying baseline security practices for every new deployment, including safe remote access and restricted permissions.
- Continually track, review, and improve my setup as my needs or hardware change.
- Maintain a single, organized place (this plan) for tracking homelab projects, pending ideas, and ongoing improvements.
